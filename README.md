# CSS Accordion Menu Project

## NAME: KSHIRA K

## ðŸ“‹ Project Overview

This project is a **pure HTML and CSS accordion-style menu**. It features multiple collapsible sections (like MILKSHAKES, FALOODA, MUTTON, etc.) where clicking on each header expands the content beneath it.

The entire functionality is implemented without JavaScript, using only HTML and CSS.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

### âœ… HTML:
- How to structure an accordion using nested elements.
- Importance of unique `id` attributes in HTML â€” especially when used with `<label for="...">`.
- How `<input type="checkbox">` can be used creatively for interactivity.

### âœ… CSS:
- Styling accordion headers and content areas clearly.
- Using `max-height`, `overflow`, and `transition` to create a smooth expand/collapse animation.
- Hiding checkboxes and using labels as clickable toggles.
- Controlling content visibility with the `:checked` pseudo-class.
